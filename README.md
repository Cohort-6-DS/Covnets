# Covnets

To deepen your understanding of covnets please use the following dataset:  www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data . This dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats (12,500 from each class) and is 543 MB (compressed). 

After downloading and uncompressing it, youâ€™ll create a new dataset containing three subsets: a training set with 1,000 samples of each class, a vali- dation set with 500 samples of each class, and a test set with 500 samples of each class.

The notebook Breaking_Cats_Dogs has the code using the library os and util to do this. Now the remaining tasks are to 

1) Pre-process the image data
2) Create a neural network architecture (use hints from the intro-to-covnets.ipynb)
